# CL25---San-Diego---BRKOPS-2570-AI-Powered-Automation
This repository includes the prompt used to generate an application with AI for Cisco Catalyst Center during the CL25 San Diego - BRKOPS-2570 Presentation. It also includes the output code of what was generated by AI for the application that was created during the demo.. 


# Catalyst Center CLI Executor

Catalyst Center CLI Executor is a Flutter application that allows users to authenticate with a backend API, view network devices and issues, and execute CLI commands on selected devices. The app is designed for network administrators to interact with Cisco Catalyst devices in a user-friendly way.

## Features

- **Device Discovery:** Lists available network devices retrieved from the backend.
- **Issue Monitoring:** Displays current issues with priority, description, affected device, and timestamp.
- **CLI Command Execution:** Allows users to send CLI commands to a selected device and view the output.
- **Dark Theme UI:** Modern, accessible interface with a dark color scheme.

## File Structure

- [`lib/my_dart_app.dart`](lib/my_dart_app.dart):  
  Main Flutter app file. Contains the `Device` and `Issue` models, the `MyApp` widget, and all UI logic for device selection, issue display, command input, and output rendering.

- [`lib/services/api_service.dart`](lib/services/api_service.dart):  
  Handles API authentication, device retrieval, issue retrieval, and command execution (not shown here, but referenced in the main app).

- `pubspec.yaml`:  
  Dart and Flutter dependencies and project metadata.

## How It Works

1. On launch, the app authenticates with the backend API.
2. It fetches the list of devices and issues, displaying them in the UI.
3. Users can select a device from a dropdown and enter a CLI command.
4. The command is sent to the backend, executed on the device, and the output is displayed in the app.

## Getting Started

1. Install [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
2. Create a flutter project.
3. Run the pubspec.yaml prompt (top of prompt file) against AI and copy paste the output into the pubspec.yaml file
4. Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies.
5. Create the directory structure under /lib for the dart files included within this repository
6. Run the rest of the prompt and copy the output into the files
7. You will need to setup your own secure credential management system in order to authenticate with your own Catalyst Center appliance
8. Run the app with `flutter run`.
