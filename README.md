# Catalyst Center CLI Executor

Catalyst Center CLI Executor is a Flutter application that allows users to authenticate with a backend API, view network devices and issues, and execute CLI commands on selected devices. The app is designed for network administrators to interact with Cisco Catalyst devices in a user-friendly way.

## Features

- **Device Discovery:** Lists available network devices retrieved from the backend.
- **Issue Monitoring:** Displays current issues with priority, description, affected device, and timestamp.
- **CLI Command Execution:** Allows users to send CLI commands to a selected device and view the output.
- **Dark Theme UI:** Modern, accessible interface with a dark color scheme.

## File Structure

- [`lib/my_dart_app.dart`](lib/my_dart_app.dart):  
  Main Flutter app file. Contains the `Device` and `Issue` models, the `MyApp` widget, and all UI logic for device selection, issue display, command input, and output rendering.

- [`lib/services/api_service.dart`](lib/services/api_service.dart):  
  Handles API authentication, device retrieval, issue retrieval, and command execution (not shown here, but referenced in the main app).

- [`test/widget_test.dart`](test/widget_test.dart):  
  Contains a basic Flutter widget test to verify the counter increments as a smoke test.

- `android/`, `ios/`, `linux/`, `macos/`, `web/`, `windows/`:  
  Platform-specific folders for building and running the Flutter app on different operating systems.

- `pubspec.yaml`:  
  Dart and Flutter dependencies and project metadata.

## How It Works

1. On launch, the app authenticates with the backend API.
2. It fetches the list of devices and issues, displaying them in the UI.
3. Users can select a device from a dropdown and enter a CLI command.
4. The command is sent to the backend, executed on the device, and the output is displayed in the app.

## Getting Started

1. Install [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
2. Clone this repository.
3. Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies.
4. Run the app with `flutter run`.
